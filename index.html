                <br style="line-height: 0.5;">&#x1F44B; hi!
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm a last-year DVM candidate @ UNMSM, working as a bionformatics intern @ <a href="https://liigh.unam.mx/">LIIGH-UNAM</a>. With strong foundations in multi-omics and medicine informatics, I enjoy developing high-performance software for genomics data and creating streamlined biological pipelines.
            </p>

            <p1>
                Here are some projects/stuff I'm doing/achieving right now:
                <ul>
                    <li>Supervised by Daniela Robles-Espinoza @ Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, I'm working on human/dog prostate cancer transcriptional parallelisms.</li>
                    <li>With Mirko Zimic @ UPCH, I am working on a thermodynamic driven DNA mutational pressure hypothesis and Tuberculosis platelet-associated molecular markers. </li>
                    <li>I'm developing <a href ="https://github.com/alejandrogzi/postoga">postoga</a> with Michael Hiller and Bogdan Kirilenko @ LOEWE Centre for Translational Biodiversity Genomics, a post-processing pipeline attached to <a href="https://github.com/hillerlab/TOGA">TOGA</a>, a novel tool to infer orthologs.</li>
                    <li>I'm about to graduate as Summa Cum Laude, after six consecutive years occupying the 1st place at my school.</li>
                </ul>
            </p1>

            <p1>
                and this is what I've done so far:
                <ul>
                    <li>I've created <a href="https://github.com/alejandrogzi/gtfsort">gtfsort</a>, a high-performance GTF sorter that uses a lexicographically-based index ordering algorithm, completely written in Rust and available <a  href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.21.563454v1">here</a>. </li>
                    <li>I've developed a suite of tools to handle fast and efficient parallelized conversions between gene-annotation formats: <a href="https://github.com/alejandrogzi/bed2gtf">bed2gtf</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alejandrogzi/bed2gff">bed2gff</a>, both written in Rust. </li>
                    <li>I've worked with Jose-Luis Rodriguez @ Universidad Complutense de Madrid on the gene expression effect in neuroblastoma cell cultures induced by <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/07482337221089585">allethrin</a>, a pyrethroid.  </li>
                    <li>I'm also the creator of: <a href="https://github.com/alejandrogzi/noel">noel<\a>, a per-gene non-overlapping exon length calculator; <a href="https://github.com/alejandrogzi/to-trans">to-trans<\a>, a transcriptome builder from fasta + GTF/GFF.</li>
                    <li>I was the founder president of the Circle of Veterinary Studies in Epidemiology @ UNMSM, a student group focused on epidemiology-related talks/research/training.</li>
                    <li>I won the 1st place in the 2021 International Congress of Biosciences (ICB-HAMUTAY) and recognized as a distinguished participant at the 2021 Pan American Veterinary Association Congress with a research in canine prostate cancer molecular markers.</li> 
                </ul>
            </p1>
