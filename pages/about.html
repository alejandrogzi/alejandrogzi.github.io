            <p>I'm a very rare case of a DVM turned bioinformatician, mainly interested in cancer genomics, translational models and software-development.</p>
            <p>Bioninformatics was a discovery I made during the 3rd year of my career. Started with R and Python to finally become a Rust advocate. During that time, I struggled a bit with surgeries and clinics to finally end up choosing to code and using my medical knowledge as an additional source of new perspectives.</p>
            <p>I study cancer translational models using genomics/transcriptomics data. Currently, I am working in human/dog prostate cancer transcriptional parallelisms and developing the first gene-fusion atlas of the dog. </p>
            <p>I'm broadly interested in the intersection of medicine, cancer, and advanced computational genomics. Leveraging my background in multi-omics and medicine informatics, I thrive on developing high-performance software that aids in the understanding of complex genetic data.</p>
            <p>While working as a bioinformatics intern, I have had the opportunity to not only explore cancer genomics but also delve into software development, creating a set of high-performance tools and working on collaborative projects in different countries developing pipelines.</p>
            <p>I am a huge advocate for open source, believing in the power of collaboration and transparency in scientific advancements. To know me more or see the things I can do, check my <a style = "border-style: solid;" href="https://alejandrogzi.github.io/pages/blog.html">blog</a>!</p>
